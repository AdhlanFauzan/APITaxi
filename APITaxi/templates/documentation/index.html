<h1>Overview</h1>

<h2>client &#8644; search engine &#8644; RGT &#8644; operator &#8644; taxi</h2>
The French "<b>Registre Géolocalisé des Taxis</b>" (RGT) aims to connect taxis and their clients. Clients can use taxis <b>search engines</b> to hail taxis geolocated by taxis <b>operators</b>. The RGT mediates between search engines and operators. <br>
In order to ensure maximum reliability, communication of the location and availability of taxis must be made directly from an on-board equipment in the taxi to the RGT. All other interactions with the RGT can be made from the central infrastructure of taxi operators (resp. search engines).


<h2>APIs implementation</h2>
This documentation provides an overview of the RGT REST APIs. REST APIs provide access to resources (data entities) via URI paths. To use a REST API, your application will make an HTTPS request and parse the response. Your methods will be the standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT and POST. REST APIs operate over HTTPS making it easy to use with any programming language or framework. The input and output format for the RGT REST APIs is <a href="http://www.json.org" target="_blank">JSON</a>.<br>


<a name="headers"><h2>Mandatory HTTP Headers</h2></a>

The following HTTP Headers are mandatory for all requests to the RGT REST APIs:
<table class="table-desc">
    <th>
        <td><h4>Name</h3></td>
        <td><h4>Description</h3></td>
        <td><h4>Value</h3></td>
    </th>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>Accept</td>
        <td>media types which are acceptable for the response</td>
        <td>application/json</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>X-VERSION</td>
        <td>Version of the APIs</td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>X-API-KEY</td>
        <td>API Key</td>
        <td>{{ apikey }}</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<a name="authentication"><h2>Authentication</h2></a>
Authentication of your application is done for each query to the RGT by including a HTTP header X-API-KEY.<br>
API keys are available for accredited developpers on the <a href="user_key">"Clé" page</a> of the main menu.
